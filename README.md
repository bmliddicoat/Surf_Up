# Surf_Up
## Overview of the statistical analysis:
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, I retrieved all the temperatures for the month of June and December.  The prospective investor, W. Avy, wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.  Standard deviation statistics will help show trends within temperature between each month.  

## Results:

### June Temperature

### December Temperature

* The mean temperature of June is around 75.  The mean temperature of December is 71.  
* The minimum temperature (64) and max temperature (85) of June. The minimum (56) and the max (83.0000000
* The standard deviation between the months is around 3.26 for June and December is around 3.75.  This means that variance between temperature daily are around these standard deviations of temperature.


Summary:

Weather in Hawaiâ€™i does not very much compared to most places in the world.  June and December temperature comparison further expose this idea.  Although December has lower temperatures, there is not a stark difference between June and December on the average temperatures.  One area that shows the biggest discrepancy is minimum temperature in December (56) to June (64).  This shows that December more likely to have an "uncomfortable" lower temperature day.  I completed a two more queries on precipitation within the two months.  Rain/precipitation could impact tourist more than slightly lower temperatures.

In evaluating the data, the trend with precipitation follows with temperature.  December has higher maximum precipitation but in comparing standard deviation between each month the difference in not that distinctive.  June is a better month to travel but travel in December would not likely cause discomfort. 

The data shows that weather between the "seasons" does very but not drastically.  The store would be able to operate year-round.  Further investigation into sunny days and other temperature variants, could provide more data to support this conclusion and as well provide insight on services provided to customers.
